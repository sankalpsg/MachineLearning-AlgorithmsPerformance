Findings/AnswerQuestion 1: To what extent does the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms depend on the size and 
complexity of the data? Answer:: The effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms depends to a vast extent on the size of the data. 
From the chart given above, it is observed that the prediction metrics vary with the number of data-points taken into consideration. 
Although, it cannot be conclusively said that the higher the size of the data, the better the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms.
The chart clearly depicts instances where the size of the dataset has noticeable effect on the effectiveness but there are instances where
a larger dataset has resulted in the lowering of effectiveness of the algorithm. The effectiveness of thealgorithm depends on the 
complexity of the problem i.e.how a dependent variable is related to the independent variable. There needs to be enough data to
capture this relationship that may or may not exist between input and output variables. From the above chart, it was also observed 
that the effectiveness of the algorithm also depends on the complexity of the data. It was observed that for data without noise, the 
predictions were accurate or close to accurate thus increasing effectiveness. From our observation,if a dataset contains many number 
of features thatare irrelevant tothe data that is to be predicted, the predictionquality of the model decreases.
Hence simply adding features which are not relevant to the output, will reduce the effectiveness of the algorithm.
